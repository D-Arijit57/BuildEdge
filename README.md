BuildEdge is a home buying and selling website that also provides a platform for finding home decoration items to enhance your living spaces. This repository contains the source code for the BuildEdge website, which has been developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing platform for users to explore and engage in the home buying and decoration process.

*Features*

The initial version of BuildEdge includes the following features:

1.Home Listings: Users can browse through a variety of home listings available for buying and selling. Each listing provides essential details such as property size, location, price, and contact information for the seller.

2.Home Decoration Items: BuildEdge offers a curated selection of home decoration items that users can explore and purchase. These items are categorized into different sections to make the browsing experience more convenient.

3.Responsive Design: Optimize the website to ensure a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes, including mobile phones and tab.

*Future Enhancements:*

We have plans to add more exciting features and improvements to the BuildEdge website in the future. Some of the enhancements we are considering include:

1.User Reviews and Ratings: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for the listed properties and decoration items, enabling potential buyers to make informed decisions.
Advanced Search Filters: Enhance the search functionality by adding additional filters such as property type, amenities, and more, to provide users with more refined search results.

2.Interactive Home Tours: Introduce virtual home tours or interactive 360-degree views for selected properties, allowing users to explore homes virtually.

3.User Messaging System: Implement a messaging system to facilitate communication between buyers and sellers, enabling them to negotiate prices, arrange viewings, and ask questions directly through the platform.

4.User Authentication: Users can create an account and log in to access additional features such as saving favorite listings, contacting sellers, and managing personal profile information.
